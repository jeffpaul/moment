# Project Moment — CLAUDE.md
# Claude Code project memory for the Moment WordPress plugin prototype.
# Place this file in your WordPress installation root (same level as wp-config.php).
# Update bracketed values after Phase 0 environment checks.

## Plugin identity

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Public product name | Project Moment |
| Plugin name | Moment |
| Plugin slug | `moment` |
| Plugin directory | `moment/` |
| Main plugin file | `moment/moment.php` |
| Text domain | `moment` |
| REST namespace | `/wp-json/moment/v1/` |
| Block namespace | `moment/*` |
| PHP class prefix | `Moment_` |
| PHP namespace | `Moment\` (optional alternative) |
| Action/filter prefix | `moment_` |
| Shortcode prefix | `moment_` |

**NEVER use in code**: `project-moment`, `project_moment`, `projectmoment`

## Environment

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| WordPress version | 7.0-beta3-61869 |
| PHP version | 8.2.27 (site) / 8.5.7 (CLI) |
| WP 7.0 AI Client available | **yes** — via `ai` plugin 0.4.1: class is `WordPress\AiClient\AiClient` (namespaced; the legacy `WP_AI_Client` name does NOT exist). Anthropic/Google/OpenAI provider plugins active. |
| Site URL | http://wp70.local |
| Plugin path | ~/Local Sites/wp70/app/public/wp-content/plugins/moment (symlink → ~/GitHub/jeffpaul/moment) |
| Local environment | Local by Flywheel (site: wp70) |

**Repo layout note:** This repo root IS the plugin. `moment.php` lives at the repo root, and the repo is symlinked into the wp70 site's plugins directory as `moment/`. The `docs/` directory and `.claude/` are excluded from distribution via `.distignore`. Runtime gates (`wp plugin activate`, `wp eval`) run from `~/Local Sites/wp70/app/public` and require the wp70 site to be started in Local.

## Build commands

```bash
# Activate/deactivate
wp plugin activate moment
wp plugin deactivate moment

# PHP tests (from the repo root)
composer install
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' 127.0.0.1 7.0   # once per machine
WP_TESTS_DIR=$TMPDIR/wordpress-tests-lib composer test   # macOS ($TMPDIR); /tmp on Linux/CI

# WP-CLI smoke suite (57 assertions) against a live site with the plugin active
WP=/path/to/wp-cli-wrapper bash tests/smoke.sh

# PHP linting (WordPress Coding Standards)
composer phpcs

# Browser E2E (Playwright; needs a live site + admin creds)
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium   # once per machine
WP_BASE_URL=http://wp70.local WP_ADMIN_USER=<user> WP_ADMIN_PASS=<pass> npx playwright test

# Watch for JS changes (if build step added)
npm run start

# Production build (if build step added)
npm run build
```

## Phase status

Update this after each phase completes. Do not mark DONE unless the phase gate passed.

- [x] Phase 0: Environment + CLAUDE.md verified (AI Client runtime check deferred to Phase 4 — requires wp70 running)
- [x] Phase 1: Plugin scaffold + activation (gate PASSED: activated cleanly; Moment_Plugin exists; 5 section pages created; /moment redirects unauthenticated → wp-login)
- [x] Phase 2: REST API + publisher (gate PASSED: unauthenticated GET /moments → 401; all 5 routes registered; note-Moment publish smoke test created post with full meta)
- [x] Phase 3: Frontend app shell (gate PASSED: authenticated /moment → 200, `<title>Moment</title>`, momentApp config inlined, zero wp-admin/admin-bar references)
- [x] Phase 4: AI Assist adapter (gate PASSED: all keys present; REAL path live — Anthropic via core AI Client; mock fallback deterministic under wp_supports_ai=false)
- [x] Phase 5: Syndication routing + connectors (gate PASSED: image→instagram + note→bluesky defaults; 7 connectors registered; mock publish round-trip stores _moment_external_posts and sets status to 'mocked')
- [x] Phase 6: Conversation backflow + notifications (gate PASSED + independently re-verified: sync imports labeled mock replies as standard WP comments; repeat sync deduped; notifications include 'Reply from Bluesky' item and exclude non-Moment post comments; non-Moment sync → 404)
- [x] Phase 7: Blocks and shortcodes (gate PASSED: all 5 shortcodes + all 5 moment/* dynamic blocks registered; /timeline page renders Moments; shortcode and block output byte-identical via shared renderer)
- [x] Phase 8: PWA + home screen (gate PASSED: manifest reachable + valid JSON; icon-192/512 PNGs generated from icon.svg and served 200; conservative SW at assets/moment-sw.js — caches only app.css/app.js, never REST/nonces/admin/HTML)
- [x] Phase 9: E2E tests (gate PASSED: WP-CLI smoke suite tests/smoke.sh 57/57 against live wp70; PHPUnit scaffolded — needs WP test lib (`WP_TESTS_DIR=/tmp/wordpress-tests-lib composer test`); Playwright scaffolded, not run — needs `npm i -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium`)

## Key architectural decisions

Document decisions here as they are made. This is the authoritative record.

| Decision | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Content model | Standard `post` post type | Portability; standard feeds/comments/templates |
| Custom post type | Not used | Deactivation safety; standard theme compat |
| Route strategy | Rewrite rule + `template_include` on a `moment_app` query var | No page dependency; full control of app-shell markup (no theme chrome); clean `/moment` PWA scope. Section pages (`/timeline`, `/images`, `/videos`, `/audio`, `/notes`) are auto-created pages with shortcodes since those should render inside the theme. |
| Block vs shortcode | **Both** — shortcodes as required baseline, dynamic blocks (`block.json` + `render.php`, no build step) as thin wrappers | Activation pages already embed `[moment_*]` shortcodes; MVP spec requires both; all query/markup logic lives once in `Moment_Renderer::render()` so both surfaces emit identical HTML |
| WP 7.0 AI path | **Real** — `WordPress\AiClient\AiClient` via `wp_ai_client_prompt()`; provider Anthropic (first configured). Mock fallback when no provider is configured or any call fails. | Plugin requires WP 7.0+, so the AI Client is assumed present (no class/function existence shims). Detection: `wp_supports_ai()` + ≥1 `isProviderConfigured()`. Never throws, never blocks publishing. Legacy `WP_AI_Client` name does not exist — do not use it for calls. |
| JS framework | Vanilla ES2020, no build step | Prototype speed; no npm required |
| Brand colors | Purples: primary `#7A00DF`, deep `#5300BE`, light `#D7A7FF`, transparent `rgba(122, 0, 223, 0.12)` | Documented in README "Colors" and applied throughout the app shell (`--moment-accent*` custom props), views, manifest, theme-color, and icon. |
| Destination visibility | Only **connected** connectors are offered as publish destinations; auto-applied type defaults filter to connected too (explicit API selections honored as-is). AI Assist UI only renders when a provider `is_available()`. No demo-mode filter — the site itself is always the canonical destination. | A destination that can't publish or return replies shouldn't be offered. E2E tests exercise the real connected path via fake Bluesky creds + the stubbed AT Protocol API in `tests/e2e/fixtures/moment-e2e-bluesky-stub.php`. Model defaults stay recorded in `_moment_default_destinations`. |
| Destination memory | Explicit per-type selections are remembered in `moment_destination_prefs` user meta and win over model defaults on the next publish of that type (explicit empty = "none" is remembered too). | Publishing habits differ per person and per content type; `Moment_Publisher::get_effective_defaults()` is the single resolution point used by both the app shell and the publisher's no-selection fallback. |
| Federation backflow | `Moment_Federated_Comments` labels replies delivered by ActivityPub (`protocol=activitypub`), ATmosphere (`protocol=atproto`), and Webmention (`protocol=webmention`) plugins at read time in notifications; reaction comment types (like/repost) are excluded (`type=comment` query). `Moment_Syndication_Links` renders `u-syndication` markup on singular Moment posts for Bridgy backfeed. | Federation plugins store replies as native WP comments — Moment's storage model — so push-based backflow needs only labeling, not import. No dependency on the plugins; pure comment-meta detection (schemas verified from plugin source). |

## Content model quick reference

```php
// Required post fields
post_type    = 'post'                     // NEVER 'moment' custom type
post_status  = 'publish' or 'draft'       // based on capability
post_title   = generated from caption     // or timestamp fallback
post_content = block markup               // core/image, core/video, etc.

// Required post meta
_moment_is_moment              = '1'
_moment_primary_type           = image|video|audio|podcast|note|gallery|mixed
_moment_media_ids              = JSON array of attachment IDs
_moment_syndication_targets    = JSON array of selected connector IDs
_moment_default_destinations   = JSON array of default connector IDs
_moment_syndication_status     = not_attempted|mocked|queued|published|failed
_moment_external_posts         = JSON object of external post references
_moment_comment_backflow_enabled = '1' or '0'
_moment_ai_assist_used         = '0' or '1'
_moment_created_from           = 'mobile'
```

## Action hooks (must fire in correct order)

```php
do_action('moment_register_connectors', $registry);  // on init
do_action('moment_published', $post_id, $moment_data);  // after successful post creation
do_action('moment_syndication_complete', $post_id, $results);  // after connector publish
do_action('moment_import_responses', $post_id, $network_id);  // backflow trigger
```

## REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth required |
|--------|------|--------------|
| POST | `/moment/v1/moments` | Yes — edit_posts + nonce |
| GET | `/moment/v1/moments` | Yes — edit_posts + nonce |
| POST | `/moment/v1/ai/suggestions` | Yes — edit_posts + nonce |
| POST | `/moment/v1/moments/{id}/sync-responses` | Yes — edit_posts + nonce |
| GET | `/moment/v1/notifications` | Yes — edit_posts + nonce |

## Security checklist (apply to every endpoint and form handler)

- [ ] `current_user_can()` before any write
- [ ] Nonce verified via `X-WP-Nonce` header
- [ ] Inputs sanitized with `sanitize_text_field()` / `wp_kses_post()` / `absint()`
- [ ] MIME type validated before `wp_handle_upload()` — not just extension
- [ ] All output escaped with `esc_html()` / `esc_attr()` / `esc_url()`
- [ ] No direct DB queries without `$wpdb->prepare()`
- [ ] No unauthenticated publishing endpoints

## Sub-agent directory

These agents are defined in `.claude/agents/`. The orchestrator delegates to them by name.

| Agent | File | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| `wp-php-core` | `.claude/agents/wp-php-core.md` | PHP, REST API, publisher, AI adapter |
| `moment-frontend` | `.claude/agents/moment-frontend.md` | App shell, screens, CSS, JS, PWA |
| `moment-syndication` | `.claude/agents/moment-syndication.md` | Connector registry, routing, metadata |
| `moment-backflow` | `.claude/agents/moment-backflow.md` | Backflow import, notifications endpoint |
| `moment-tester` | `.claude/agents/moment-tester.md` | PHPUnit, WP-CLI smoke tests, Playwright |

## Project artifact context

These files are loaded into context at session start. All are in the docs/ directory.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `00_README.md` | Architecture overview |
| `02_one_page_product_brief.md` | Product shape |
| `04_prototype_mvp_spec.md` | MVP scope and non-goals |
| `08_decisions_and_open_questions.md` | Resolved constraints |
| `09_default_syndication_routing.md` | Routing model |
| `11_conversation_backflow_notifications.md` | Backflow product model |
| `12_content_model_technical_path.md` | Content model |
| `13_success_metrics_and_e2e_tests.md` | Acceptance tests |

## Non-goals (never build these in the prototype)

- Real social API publishing
- Real social comment/reply polling or webhooks
- Custom post type (unless hard constraint appears)
- AI provider API key storage
- Plugin marketplace or settings dashboard
- wp-admin chrome or site management features in Moment UI
- Multi-user or team workflows beyond standard WordPress roles
- Full offline PWA mode (manifest + conservative service worker only)
- Push notifications

## Strategic line

WordPress does not need to become a social network.
It needs to become the best place for social-shaped content to begin.
